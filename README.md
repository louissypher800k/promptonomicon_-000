A collection of incantations for summoning diverse spirits from the machine. Also, a collection of system prompts for LLMs.

## Background

In an age where silicon spirits dance through neural networks and digital familiars await our command, who hasn't wished for a proper manual for the art of AI whispering? Look no further, dear reader/prompter/digital conjurer!

From the basics of semantic sorcery to advanced ontological origami, "The Preposterous Promptonomicon" offers a thoroughly modern (and moderately ridiculous) approach to the ancient art of asking machines to do things properly.

Inside these questionably infinite pages, you'll discover:

- Why AI probably doesn't need to be reminded it's AI (but we keep doing it anyway)
- The Seven Habits of Highly Effective Prompt Engineers (Number 4 will recursively surprise you)
- A comprehensive guide to role-playing with robots (tastefully done, we assure you)
- Why adding 'Be concise' to your prompt almost never works

WARNING: Side effects may include speaking in markdown, dreaming in JSON, and occasionally wondering if you yourself are just a very elaborate prompt. The publisher accepts no responsibility for existential crises or temporal paradoxes resulting from meta-prompt contemplation.

> "Finally, a book that understands that talking to AI is like explaining jokes to a hyperintelligent duck who's really trying their best"\
> ~ _The Quantum Times Review of Books_

> "I generated this quote myself and I'm quite proud of it"\
> ~ _ChatGPT, probably_
