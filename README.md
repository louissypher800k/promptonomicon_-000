A collection of incantations for summoning diverse spirits from the machine. Also, a collection of system prompts for LLMs.

I will keep adding to this over time.

## Background

"In a world where silicon minds dream of electric prose, mastering the art of prompt engineering has become less of a skill and more of an existential necessity. Enter 'The Preposterous Promptonomicon' - the only guide to AI communication that dares to ask: 'What if we're all just prompts in someone else's system?'

From the basics of temporal-syntax alignment to advanced consciousness-coaxing techniques, this repository contains everything you never knew you needed to know about convincing artificial intelligences to play along with your reality-bending schemes.
